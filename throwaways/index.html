    <p>A natural language is a language that has developed naturally through use and includes all of the linguistic levels—phonology, morphology, lexicon, syntax, and discourse. English and American Sign Language (ASL) are both full, natural languages.</p>

<p>Since it is a natural language, ASL has a rich and complex syntax and grammar. It is not based on English and does not follow the same structure as English.</p>

<p>Like all languages, ASL is a living language that grows and changes over time. </p>

    <h3> Most Common Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Delusions are when you think things are happening that aren't real. Hallucinations are when you are seeing or hearing things that aren't real. Disorganized thinking or speech comes with difficulty communicating with others or having what is called, “word salad.” “Word salad” is when a person says a lot of unrelated and confusing words or phrases at once. Also, having unrelated answers to questions. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior varies from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behaviors can include not following directions, inappropriate or strange postures, complete lack of response or unnecessary movement. Finally, there are negative symptoms like neglect of personal hygiene. Some may seem to have a lack of emotion, loss in interest in everyday activities or social withdraw. Men are usually diagnosed in their early-mid 20s and Women in their late 20s. It's uncommon to diagnosed children and extremely rare to be diagnosed after 45.  Although it's uncommon to be diagnosed as child schizophrenia still develops in the teenage years. Teenagers have their own types of symptoms like withdrawal from family or friends or dropping in grades. They also might experience trouble sleeping, irritable or depressed moods or lack of motivation. Compared with adults, teenagers are less likely to have delusions and more likely to have visual hallucinations.</p>

  <h3> Proable Causes</h3>
  <p>Although the causes for schizophrenia are unknown researchers think that genetics, environment, and brain chemistry have the most to do with it. Chemicals in your brain like neurotransmitters called glutamate and dopamine can contribute to schizophrenia naturally. Even though there no real causes for schizophrenia certain factors seem to increase the risks of getting this disorder.  Having someone in your family who had/has schizophrenia or an increase in immune system activation. Having an older age of your father or pregnancy/birth complications with your mother. Taking any drugs that alter your mind during teenage years and young adulthood may also increase your chances. </p>

  <h3> Treatment Options</h3>
  <p>There is no cure for schizophrenia but it can be treated. The most common ways are by antipsychotic medications and psychotherapy. There are four main types of psychotherapy. The first is psychodynamic which helps access pushed down feelings,  memories and unconscious thoughts, dream analysis, interpretations, and self-insight. It usually takes a lot of sessions to have a breakthrough, even sometimes four to five visits a week. The second type is called existential-humanistic. This strategy helps the patients have the ability for making rational choices, achieving self-acceptance and attaining their maximum potentials. The existential part maximizes human potential, their meaning in life, overcoming existential fears, and accessing their “genuine self”. The humanistic part is mostly therapist tactics like being empathetic, genuine and having an accepting environment. Also, the therapist uses active listening and makes safe non-judgmental places to help their client’s self-acceptance, makes then feel valued, and reaching their own self-actualization. The third type is behavioral and inside behavior, there are three subsections which are exposure, systematic desensitization,  and aversive conditioning. Exposure therapy is treating anxiety by having a person face their fears by exposing them to real or imagined situations they typically would avoid. Aversive conditioning involves pairing an unpleasant reaction with the targeted behavior. Fourth, systematic desensitization is a type of exposure therapy that starts with a relaxed state of mind and gradually increases anxiety. Lastly, there is cognitive which is changing what we say to ourselves to cope with our anxieties and modify our behavior. In cognitive, there are two subsections, group therapy, and family therapy. Group therapy is conducted with groups rather than being by yourself letting you know that you are not alone and also letting you become more comfortable with others. Family therapy is a type of therapy that treats the family as a system that views an individual's unwanted behaviors as influenced by other family members. If untreated or treated improperly schizophrenia can have some ugly by-products. Some may include suicidal thoughts or actions, self-injury, anxiety or OCD, depression, abuse of alcohol or drugs, inability to work or go to school, legal or financial problems, social isolation, health or medical problems, or aggressive behavior(although uncommon).</p> -->
